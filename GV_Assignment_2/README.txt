Hi Karsten,

I just wanted to let you know that for some reason, my sounds don't always work, as well as the animations. My most stable sound is the background noise, and the most stable animations are idle and run. The death animation usually works after a few asteroids reached the bottom. I couldn't figure out why they are like this. If you have any ideas about them, and could write them down in the feedback, I'd greatly appreciate it. Also if you could tell me how could I have made more asteroids appear at the same time, it would be great. I'm planning to continue this game during the summer for practice.

Thank you for everything this year, and I wish you a great summer holiday.
I hope to see you next year either online, but eager to be in class already.

Greg
